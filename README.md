# codereference is part of my 100 days of code challenge

### codereference is a website, that I plan to use for coding templates and coding references.

### [Check it out\!](https://arturtle.github.io/codereference/index.html)

As part of the \#100daysofcode challenge, I am trying to improve my ability to write HTML/CSS and to learn JavaScript. I will be getting familiar with Git and GitHub \(markdown too\!\).
Most of my lessons will be an extension of what I learned from [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.com).

If you see any mistakes in my code or semantics please make an issue request. I hope to keep on improving! As of right now I am still learning to use *markdown*, so don't be surprised if I made any errors.
